### Overview
On this first sprint our plan is to create a template in React that the game will be added to and some core functionality.

We will also hone our skills in git version control and working along to the SCRUM framework.

## Core functionality
- React page
    - basic React template with just a Game-component that contains the canvas that will be drawn to
    - new components will be added as necessary with new backlog items
- Bus route and location data fetching
    - routes with **graphql** requests
    - location with **mqtt** subscription data
- User input management
    - read user keyboard input
    - log the events
- Draw graphics on the page
    - using **three.js** library
